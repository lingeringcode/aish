      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <h4>What is this?</h4>
      <p>"As It So Happens" is my little pet site, and a forked project from Lockridge's <a href="https://www.rhetorlist.com"></a>Rhetorlist</a>, which tracks books across the discipline. While Lockridge is <em>tracking</em> books, I am merely offerring a single place to see articles with standardized RSS feeds, <em>as they so happen</em> to be published.</p>
      <h4>Why isn't [insert x and y or z journal] included?</h4>
      <p>Any journal not listed here is by no means a product of my position about the journal. This is a new project, so I'm open to suggestions. I am sure new distinctly organized pages can eventually be created to best categorize journals. If you think a journal should be included, and it has an RSS feed with standardized XML format, please feel free to message me about it.</p>
      <h4>How did you make this?</h4>
      <p>The source is <a href="https://github.com/lingeringcode/aish">on Github</a>. Feel free to contribute with a pull request or fork and make your own.</p>
      <h4>Who maintains this?</h4>
      <p>Hey, hey. I'm Chris Lindgren. You can email me (<a href="mailto:lindgren@vt.edu">lindgren@vt.edu</a>) or tweet me (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/lndgrn">@lndgrn</a>) with your suggestions or concerns.</p>
