To address this issue, we analyze the public engagement of communication scientists by using the example of their Twitter activity. We theoretically distinguish eight types of engagement and explore their empirical prevalence. The results show that a large share of communication is between peers, fulfilling social networking functions. Nevertheless, more than a quarter of the tweets are on political and social topics. In this way, communication scientists bring society into their scholarly community and thus act as bridge builders. They also reach diverse publics outside of science, such as followers from the field of economics. Our study thus highlights the diversity of connections between science and society and can offer a starting point to further research other fields of public engagement and the impact of the discipline on the public discourse.</content:encoded>

In two studies (a lab experiment and a field test), we examine how the presentation of news information—traditional, summary news headlines or clickbait, curiosity news headlines—influences the attitudinal and behavioral components of news seeking. Study 1 models the news-seeking process, finding that summary headlines heighten perceptions of headline information adequacy, which increase expectations that an article will provide clear information, which in turn increase anticipated audience engagement with news compared to some curiosity headlines. Study 2 determines that individuals’ selection behavior on nine local newspaper websites also favors summary headlines. The findings encourage researchers to employ information-seeking mechanisms in understanding news selection decisions.</content:encoded>

In this current research, two methodological approaches are applied to gain understandings of social boundary construction on twitter: thematic analysis of the content of tweets and social network analysis (SNA) of how messages are diffused and contested. Twitter is shown to be an important platform in spreading positive narratives about Muslims during the fire, enabling individuals to spontaneously contest fake news and hate narratives. Social media acts counter to established knowledge, demonstrating that it is not, per se, a conduit for fake news and hate speech. Furthermore, it demonstrates how twitter offers Muslims an international space to voice and articulate themselves where they can be influential in debates that effect Muslim diasporas in other national contexts.</content:encoded>

This article explores when people read by listening and whether there may be a shift regarding the places and times people read by listening rather than by seeing. Based on a considerable dataset from a Swedish subscription service for digital books, this article reveals that audiobook reading takes place at somewhat different times than expected and that subscribers read significant amounts each day. The findings indicate that the remediation into reading by listening using digital audiobooks may close the gender gap common in reading, as the reading practices of men and women are very similar, with men even reading slightly more than women. The reading practices of young adults are also similar to the larger population. Furthermore, the concepts stationary reading, mobile reading and stationary/mobile reading are introduced.</content:encoded>

      <title>Tinder’s lesbian digital imaginary: Investigating (im)permeable boundaries of sexual identity on a popular dating app</title>

However, little research has investigated the experiences of women seeking women (WSW) on this app. This article combines two interview studies of WSW in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom to investigate their self-presentations of sexual identity on Tinder. By configuring settings to “seeking women,” participants perceived they were entering a space conducive to finding WSW. However, men, couples, and heterosexual women permeated this space, heightening the need for participants to signal non-heterosexual identity. Their signals fused references to lesbian and queer culture with Tinder’s infrastructure to evoke a digital imaginary, as a routinized set of practices imagined to resonate with a shared community.

However, little research has investigated the experiences of women seeking women (WSW) on this app. This article combines two interview studies of WSW in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom to investigate their self-presentations of sexual identity on Tinder. By configuring settings to “seeking women,” participants perceived they were entering a space conducive to finding WSW. However, men, couples, and heterosexual women permeated this space, heightening the need for participants to signal non-heterosexual identity. Their signals fused references to lesbian and queer culture with Tinder’s infrastructure to evoke a digital imaginary, as a routinized set of practices imagined to resonate with a shared community. Although signals within this digital imaginary were sometimes playful and ambiguous, their default toward a recognizable lesbian identity often rendered other sexual or gender identities invisible.</description>

This study builds on this positive effects scholarship: together, the two studies presented herein aim to provide an understanding of the inspirational content available on Facebook and the way social media users in the United States encounter, recall, and interact with this content. Results from the quantitative content analysis in Study 1 show that inspirational Facebook posts contain similar frequencies of hope and appreciation of beauty and excellent elicitors when compared with other forms of media and social media. Results from the national survey conducted in Study 2 show that social media users are most often inspired by portrayals of kindness and overcoming obstacles and that Facebook users did not report different sharing behavior as compared with users of other social media sites.</content:encoded>

In this article, we present an innovative methodology for demonstrating how young people and their digital practices are visually depicted. We focus on stock photography produced by the commercial image banks which source the news media with much of its imagery. Following an indicative analysis of news media images, we present a social semiotic analysis (grounded also in a descriptive content analysis) of a dataset of 600 stock photos top-sliced from three major image banks. By pinpointing dominant representational, compositional and interpersonal meanings, we show how image banks and, in turn, the news media produce a rather pessimistic metadiscursive framing of ‘teens and technology’. These influential visualizations are often reductionistic – consistently centering technologies over relationships; they are also problematic in, for example, their inexplicably gendered and classist assumptions.</content:encoded>

We apply this central sociological idea to the social media context. We conduct a large-scale online study to investigate whether observers can correctly guess the education of others from their Facebook profile pictures. Using the binomial test and cross-classified mixed-effects models, we show that observers can assess the education of depicted persons better than chance, especially when they share the same educational background and have experience with the social media. We also find that posting pictures of outdoor activities is a strong signal of having higher education, while professional photographs can obscure education signals. The findings expand our knowledge of social interaction and self-expression online and offer new insights for understanding social influence on social media.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;What sustains prosocial attitudes and political engagement in the era of online connectivity? Scholars disagree on whether frequent consumers of virtual entertainment disconnect from sociopolitical life. Using the Swedish Political Socialization Panel dataset and partial-pool time series methodology, I investigate the relationship between playing videogames and adolescents’ political and social attitudes over time. I find that those gamers who spend more time engaging in their favorite pastime become less interested in sociopolitical issues and less prosocial than non-gamers from year to year. My findings tell a cautionary tale about the adverse effects of extensive gaming on the development of democratic attitudes among adolescents.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This qualitative study explores the sexting experiences of college-aged students with attention to gendered understandings and motivations of sexting. We gathered data on the decision-making process, relational contexts in which sexting occurred, body-image management, and perceived outcomes of past experiences. Participants in this study were asked to describe two experiences of sexting behavior in short vignettes, and then they were prompted to respond to additional questions about the vignette and sexting. A total of 342 vignettes were read and analyzed using discourse analytic strategies of reading for positioning, construction of discourses, and implied actions.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Online media sites such as Breitbart News in the United States and The Canary in the United Kingdom have come to prominence as powerful new agents. Their reach and influence in the contemporary digital media ecology have been widely highlighted, yet there has been little scholarship to situate these important new players in the field of political communication. This article argues that, first, these ‘interlopers’ known as the ‘alt-right’ and ‘alt-left’ need to be understood as embedded in the context of populist politics. Second, ‘hyperpartisan’ describes these sites better than the framework of alternative media as it mirrors populism’s ideological pillar of ‘us’ versus ‘them’. Finally, a deliberate provocation is argued to name these digital start-ups as news to create a starting point for conceptualising these disruptive new media forces.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Despite the concern that partisan selectivity in the political use of social media leads to mass polarization, the empirical evidence is mixed at best. Given the possibility that these inconclusive findings are attributable to moderators in the process that have not been adequately studied, this article elaborates the roles played by different forms of social identities. By analyzing three datasets collected in Hong Kong, where Chinese and Hong Kongese identities are constructed in a nonmutually exclusive way, this study demonstrates that (1) partisan selectivity in media use is reliably detected among those with single Hong Kongese identity, but not among those with dual identities of Hong Kongese and Chinese, (2) the political use of social media polarizes the attitudes and affects of single identifiers, whereas it has depolarizing effects on dual identifiers, and (3) these contrasting effects on polarization between single and dual identifiers have downstream consequences for political participation.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study is the first to scrutinize the psychological effects of online astroturfing in the context of Russia’s digitally enabled foreign propaganda. Online astroturfing is a communicative strategy that uses websites, “sock puppets,” or social bots to create the false impression that a particular opinion has widespread public support. We exposed N = 2353 subjects to pro-Russian astroturfing comments and tested: (1) their effects on political opinions and opinion certainty and (2) the efficiency of three inoculation strategies to prevent these effects. All effects were investigated across three issues and from a short- and long-term perspective. Results show that astroturfing comments can indeed alter recipients’ opinions, and increase uncertainty, even when subjects are inoculated before exposure. We found exclusively short-term effects of only one inoculation strategy (refutational-same). As these findings imply, preemptive media literacy campaigns should deploy (1) continuous rather than one-time efforts and (2) issue specific rather than abstract inoculation messages.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article sets out findings from a project focused on #stopIslam, a hashtag that gained prominence following the Brussels terror attack of 2016. We initially outline a big data analysis which shows how counter-narratives – criticizing #stopIslam – momentarily subverted negative news reporting of Muslims. The rest of the article details qualitative findings that complicate this initial positive picture. We set out key tactics engaged in by right-wing actors, self-identified Muslim users, would-be allies and celebrities and elucidate how these tactics were instrumental in the direction, dynamics and legacies of the hashtag. We argue that the tactical interventions of tightly bound networks of right-wing actors, as well as the structural constraints of the platform, not only undermined the longevity and coherence of the counter-narratives but subtly modulated the affordances of Twitter in ways that enabled these users to extend their voice outwards, reinforcing long-standing representational inequalities in the process.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The parallel media related to sports, gaming and gambling are expanding, exemplified by the emergence of esports and game-related gambling (e.g. loot boxes, esports betting). The increasing convergence of these phenomena means it is essential to understand how they interact. Given the expanding consumer base of esports, it is important to know how individuals’ backgrounds and consumption of game media may lead to esports betting. This study employs survey data (N = 1368) to investigate how demographics, alongside consumption of video games, esports and gambling can predict esports betting activity. Results reveal that both spectating esports and participation in general forms of gambling are associated with increased esports betting, no direct association was observed between the consumption of video games and esports betting. Findings suggest that while games may act as a vehicle for gambling content, highlighting the convergence of gaming and gambling, there is no intrinsic aspect which directly encourages gambling behaviours.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article explores the Facebook unfriending of users from a majority group by members of a minority group, focusing on Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel. Indeed, this is the first study to focus on power differentials among Facebook users in the context of unfriending. The article thus adds depth to our understanding of unfriending, while also shedding light on the experience of social media use from the perspective of an oppressed minority. Based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with twenty ’48 Palestinians (Palestinian citizens of Israel), we present various triggers for unfriending (mainly, encounters with racism and surveillance), and show that Palestinians’ stories of unfriending Jewish Israelis are sometimes about punching up and sometimes about stepping away. However, while unfriending is broadly considered an apt response to abuse, it also distances Palestinians from centers of power in Israel. This suggests an important way in which social media reproduce inequality.</content:encoded>

This suggests an important way in which social media reproduce inequality.</description>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Parents have long been encouraged to treat their child’s development as a capability, with the imperative being to maximize this capability. At the same time, however, children’s ‘natural’ process of development must be allowed to take its course. Digital media technologies promise to not only enhance children’s developmental capacity, but also threaten to disrupt their normal development. Drawing on qualitative research involving 40 Australian parents, this article examines parents’ concerns about their teenage children’s use of digital media. It examines how parents negotiate the tension between technological development and the benefits it affords their child, and the perceived risks that technological development poses to their child’s normal development, through mediating what they construct as positive and negative exposure to digital media. Parents distinguished between media use that was considered to enhance their child’s development and use that had the potential to disrupt it, by categorizing various activities as appropriate and inappropriate.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Social networks are generally regarded as channels through which parliamentarians establish direct contact with the public. However, do they engage in these activities personally or rather delegate them to their parliamentary assistants? This study examines the intermediary relationship between parliamentarians and the public (henceforth PAs)—seeking to understand their role in contemporary, political communications. While numerous studies have looked at types of parliamentarian contact with the public, PAs have received little scholarly attention. Adopting a comparative perspective, this study will suggest a theoretical model of the MP/PA social media work relationship, creating a new questionnaire for PAs in the US House of Representatives, German Bundestag, and Israeli Knesset, exploring whether level of parliamentarians’ involvement in social networking is influenced by working within different electoral systems: representatives elected directly (the United States), mixed (Germany), and indirectly (Israel). The study investigates the level of parliamentarians’ engagement with social media communication according to a four-category model.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Profanity, also known as swearing, refers to the use of foul language that is often linked to incivility. In Chinese digital space, the state government actively censors profanity under the rationale of protecting online civility. This study examines the diffusion of profanity in Sina Weibo, one of the largest Chinese social media platforms. The study applied computational methods to reconstruct the cascade networks of swearing and non-swearing posts and analyzed the network diffusion processes based on a set of structural metrics including reposting depth, width, and interlayer width ratios. Findings suggest profanity may influence the process of message diffusion, but this effect was ephemeral. Based on the understanding of diffusion processes of profanity online, this study contends the viral potential of profanity may not be as severe as the regulators claim. The discussion analyzes the extent to which content moderation efforts are necessary for the nurturing of civility online.</content:encoded>

Mutual expectations become visible or evolve anew. The question arises as to how these expectations and their (non-)fulfillment influence the journalist–audience relationship. Taking an interpersonal communication perspective by following expectancy violations theory, we focus on the level of interactions and propose a theoretical framework explaining how the interplay of journalists’ and audience’s mutual expectations affects their relationship.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article explores women’s accounts of receiving unsolicited dick pics from men. Drawing on material derived from in-depth interviews with adult British women, its focus is on how these interviewees relied on a postfeminist discursive framework in order to make sense of such experiences, and on how this rendered them more likely to recognise unsolicited dick pic practices as acts of sexism. As such, these women also felt encouraged to respond to their receiving of unsolicited dick pics by engaging in humorous practices of anti-sexist resistance. Still, the article also shows how the interviewees’ drawing on a postfeminist discursive framework rendered them more prone to approach unsolicited dick pic practices and sexism in individualised and decontextualised manners, meaning that they failed to recognise and critically address the broader social structures that enable dick pics to circulate online as acts of sexism in the first place.</content:encoded>

Through structural equation modeling, results demonstrated that having a relationship with the victim or other bystanders mediated the relationship between observing cyberbullying behavior and bystanders’ use of aggressive language online. The effect of observing cyberbullying behavior through having a relationship with the victim or other bystanders was lower than its direct effect on adolescent bystanders’ use of aggressive language.

Prior research in postsecondary education has examined the structure of social networks, imagined audiences online, openness of practice, and informational/communication patterns of academics. We conducted 92 semi-structured interviews with higher educational professionals beyond the faculty/academic role to understand motivations and challenges online.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In the context of recent controversies surrounding the censorship of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer online content, specifically on YouTube and Tumblr, we interrogate the relationship between normative understandings of sexual citizenship and the content classification regimes. We argue that these content classification systems and the platforms’ responses to public criticism both operate as norm-producing technologies, in which the complexities of sexuality and desire are obscured in order to cultivate notions of a ‘good’ lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer sexual citizen. However, despite normative work of classification seeking to distinguish between sexuality and sex, we argue that the high-profile failures of these classification systems create the conditions for users to draw attention to, rather than firm, these messy boundaries.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been drawn to gender impacts arising from adoption and usage of information and communication technologies (ICTs), the mobile phone especially, by marginalized women in the Global South. Grounded in the theory of structuration, our study challenges techno-determinism and structural functionalism embodied in a prevailing gender (dis)empowerment dichotomy, and instead reveals the contextually situated and dynamically negotiated techno-socio relationships. It allows for examination of the mobile phone in the interactions between agency of women to get empowered and their situated gendered social power structures. While the phone reinforces structural constraints via facilitating access, surveillance, and intervention from those of higher patriarchal statuses, it simultaneously enables women’s strategic responses involving avoidance, accommodation, and collaboration. The constraining yet empowering processes conceptually make the functioning of the mobile phone as socially catalyzing the development of self-consciousness by women, and furthermore, the clustering of awakening individuals toward emergent female collective power.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In the recent decades, privacy scholarship has made significant progress. Most of it was achieved in monodisciplinary works. However, privacy has a deeply interdisciplinary nature. Most importantly, societies as well as individuals experience privacy as being influenced by legal, technical, and social norms and structures. In this article, we hence attempt to connect insights of different academic disciplines into a joint model, an Interdisciplinary Privacy and Communication Model. The model differentiates four different elements: communication context, protection needs, threat and risk analysis, as well as protection enforcement. On the one hand, with this model, we aim to describe how privacy unfolds. On the other hand, the model also prescribes how privacy can be furnished and regulated. As such, the model contributes to a general understanding of privacy as a theoretical guide and offers a practical basis to address new challenges of the digital age.</content:encoded>

Through a multiplatform discourse analysis of two such scandals, this project explores how influencers, brands, and audiences utilize the affordances and norms of social media platforms to manage their roles and relationships throughout these callout campaigns. Four key strategies emerge: curation, critique, reframing, and silence. Despite the efforts of some audiences and influencers, these four strategies elided the broader social implications of brand and influencer racism as members of the community responded to the drama more than they critiqued the marginalization of people of color. Overall, this project provides insight into the dynamics at work in callout campaigns, theorizing the ways in which actors work to balance visibility, risk, labor, and control.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Building on existing theoretical frameworks for the study of incivility, interactivity, and negativity bias, this study contributes to the growing body of literature on the impact of incivility in online comments. Specifically, it tests incivility’s impact on news engagement intentions; investigates political and personality predispositions’ roles as perceptual filters; and extends this scholarship to the context of multiple scientific news topics. It found that, when dealing with news about two of the more politically divisive technologies—fracking and synthetic biology—ideology moderated the effects of incivility, with uncivil comments encouraging engagement among conservatives but not among liberals. However, in the less politically divisive context of nanotechnology, self-monitoring played a significant role in moderating incivility’s effects: with high self-monitors being more motivated, and low self-monitors less motivated, to share nanotech news after exposure to uncivil comments. These results imply that individual predispositions and topic-specific factors both underlie the impact of incivility on news engagement intentions.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article examines converging trends in ageing, digitalisation and datafication in the context of mobility and transport. While mobility data are increasingly captured by (public) transport and mobility as a service (MaaS) providers, Internet of Things (IoT) vehicles, apps and so on, the increasing entanglement of mobility and datafication happens unevenly, for example, in relation to age. This is particularly significant in the light of the rise of data-driven policy-making, and its potential impacts on mobility provision for older people. The article highlights new questions for public policy around data gaps and social inclusion and examines them through a UK case study. The results show that old age and mobility is an area with significant gaps in the data available to policy makers. A key recommendation is for commissioning bodies to develop a strategic approach to structured data gathering and analysis that addresses issues of exclusion from smart public service infrastructure.</content:encoded>

The results show that old age and mobility is an area with significant gaps in the data available to policy makers. A key recommendation is for commissioning bodies to develop a strategic approach to structured data gathering and analysis that addresses issues of exclusion from smart public service infrastructure.</description>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article builds on a growing body of research on social media and authenticity through examining practices of ‘keeping it raw’ in fitness cultures on Instagram. Such practices include posting unedited or ‘realistic’ visuals of the body, storying the everyday and ‘real talk’ about topics such as mental health and body image. Drawing on empirical findings from my research with 21 Australian women aged 20–35 who use Instagram to post and engage with fitness inspiration – fitspo – content, I specifically trace how enactments of ‘raw’ cultivate digital intimacies between Instagram users. Here, I take up a feminist new materialist approach to consider how various body parts, objects, platform functionalities and discourses come together to create affective encounters between my participants and other Instagram users. The contribution of this article lies in attending to the work that raw does, to what end and for whom.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Cyberbullying often happens in the presence of bystanders whose behaviors play a key role in changing dynamics of the situation. To examine the factors influencing cyberbystander likelihood of intervening in cyberbullying on social media, a 2 (degree of cyberbullying severity: high vs low) × 2 (level of interpersonal similarity: high vs low) between-subjects experiment was conducted (N = 132). Results indicated that cyberbystanders’ empathic responses depended on the severity of cyberbullying. The more empathy bystanders felt, the more likely they were to publicly and privately intervene. Moreover, the indirect effect of cyberbullying severity on willingness to intervene through empathy was more pronounced when the interpersonal similarity between victim and cyberbystander was low, rather than it was high.</content:encoded>

Although contemporary emoji represent a variety of races, genders, and sexual orientations, the original emoji set came under fire for its racial homogeneity: minus two “ethnic” characters, the people emoji featured in Unicode 7.0 were represented as White. This article investigates the set of circumstances that gave rise to this state of affairs, and explores the implications for users of color whose full participation in the emoji phenomenon is constrained by their exclusion. This project reveals that the lack of racial representation within the emoji set is the result of colorblind racism as evidenced through two related factors: aversion to, and avoidance of, the politics of technical systems and a refusal to recognize that the racial homogeneity of the original emoji set was problematic in the first place.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;When a moral panic happens, society believes that a group of people and/or their behaviour is responsible for a threat to society – without any evidentiary basis. How does the target group respond? In the video game context, gamers may fear that their pastime will be blamed for mass shootings leading to social stigma. Group members so threatened are hypothesized to react to protect their group identity. This leads to increased engagement in the activity under threat. In contrast, disasters that do not threaten the group would not affect the amount of video game play. We test these hypotheses by relating the amount of game play to incidents of mass shootings and non-shooting disasters for a large sample of individuals (N = 170,000). Incidents of mass shootings that threaten the gamer community lead to increases in game playing while incidents of other disasters unrelated to gaming divert time away from gaming.</content:encoded>

New means of creating shared experiences have thus become more vital, and the present study tests the value of games-based role-playing for fostering trust in immigrant populations. Students in an online American Government class at a major southeastern university were asked to create a fictional persona from Mexico, India, or China, and seek US citizenship.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article deals with potential effects of incidental online exposure to political information (IOEP) on the German electorate during the 2017 national election campaign. We argue that the difference in currently unexpected and generally unwanted exposure to political online communication is crucial to the study of IOEP effects. While the former might result in “passive learning,” we hypothesize that–based on psychological reactance theory–the latter may be linked to defensive reactions with undesirable consequences among those who already are alienated from politics. Using cross-sectional data from an online survey among 1100 eligible voters, we can demonstrate that IOEP correlates with reactance in substantial segments. The study’s results are indicating, that the viral character of online campaigning may lead to the opposite of what was intended: voters are not only “trapped,” but might be repelled instead. Further empirical elaboration dealing with causal assumptions is encouraged.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Online crowdwork platforms have been praised as powerful vehicles for economic development, particularly for workers traditionally excluded from the labor market. However, there has been insufficient scrutiny as to the feasibility of crowdwork as an income-source among socioeconomically deprived populations. This article examines device requirements and differential access to digital infrastructure, both of which act as potential barriers to not only basic participation but also to economic success online. Given the increasing prevalence of mobile-first and mobile-only populations, research on this topic aids in understanding the crowdwork ecosystem among differing socioeconomic sectors. Based on a survey of 606 crowd workers across the United States and India, this article uses both quantitative and qualitative data to explore whether reliance on mobile devices is detrimental for economic outcomes of crowdwork. The results point to substantial inequalities in device use and received benefits from crowdwork, within each country and between the two contexts.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Social media is an important transmitter of anti-immigration political rhetoric. In this study, we examine the discussions posted in a Finnish online forum provoked by an MP’s anti-multiculturalist Facebook post. We draw upon frame analysis and discursive social psychology to analyse the communicative processes that challenge and normalise anti-immigration political rhetoric. Using frame analysis, we study how forum users entered heated societal discussion on multiculturalism by framing the MP’s anti-multiculturalist address as either hate speech or – more dominantly – as normal political conduct. Using discursive social psychology, we examine constructions of multiculturalism in these discussions. We demonstrate how anti-immigration political communication was normalised, multiculturalism was constructed as a threat and the proponents of multiculturalism were discredited. We argue that to understand the rise of anti-immigration political movements, it is important to examine everyday political deliberation online as part of a wider discursive landscape.</content:encoded>

Drawing on a national survey, this study focuses on Facebook and explores the predictors of cross-cutting discussion on this platform. The results reveal that political interest is positively associated with cross-cutting discussion and this relationship is mediated by the frequency of news consumption on Facebook, suggesting that Facebook use has the potential of exposing the politically attentive to dissonant views. Furthermore, the level of heterogeneity of a person’s strong-tie network is found to accentuate the mediating effect of Facebook news consumption.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study aims to test the third-person effect (TPE) in the perception of Internet privacy risks. Support was found for a TPE model suggesting that users report greater perceived Internet privacy risks on others than on themselves, based on a sample (N = 613) from Amazon MTurk. In particular, the differential perception of Internet privacy risks between self and others increased people’s willingness to recommend protective measures to others but decreased their willingness to adopt protective measures themselves. Moreover, social distance, perceived Internet privacy knowledge, negative online privacy experiences, and Internet use activities emerged as significant predictors of TPE perceptions about Internet privacy risks. Study findings indicated that third-person perception is one of the major barriers inhibiting the adoption of privacy protection measures. The antecedents of TPE perceptions detected here provide valuable implications about how to enable Internet users to protect their privacy security.</content:encoded>

Building on the methodological frameworks established by critical information researchers like Safiya Noble, Tarleton Gillespie, and Nick Seaver, this essay argues that we do not need to reverse engineer the “black box” to understand its impacts because they can be found through qualitative methodologies instead. This essay rejects the “black box” as an epistemic premise upon which critical algorithmic literacies can be built by using discourse analysis to observe how the unknowable language of the algorithm is deployed discursively within gamer communities to establish and maintain patriarchal power. This essay shows how the “black box” is used by fan communities to advance a patriarchal understanding of what we term paradigms of “balance” and “realism” in game design.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Eudaimonic entertainment, which motivates a reflection on topics such as virtue or meaning, has many benefits, such as fostering wellbeing and inspiring prosocial behavior. Yet, it may also have a darker side when Islamic extremists use accordant elements in online propaganda. So far, this “dark inspiration” has attracted little scholarly interest. The current article fills this gap via a mixed-methods case study of an Islamic extremist influencer on Instagram. The study combined a qualitative content analysis of the account’s postings from 2016 to 2018 (n = 301 posts), with a hierarchical cluster analysis and digital data on aggregated user response to these posts. I found four types of post, ranging from calls for conservativism to calls for violent jihad. Different eudaimonic cues were used in all four types. Likes and comments varied as a function of type, with the violence promoting posts motivating the largest number of user responses.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Recent media attention aimed at migrant caravans at the US–Mexico border has increased interest from different actors in the political and social spheres. Parallel to traditional and mainstream media, social media has become the prime context where narratives about the border develop, molding broader societal perspectives on the immigration issue. Through a content and discourse analysis of 105 posts connected by the #MigrantCaravan or #CaravanaMigrante hashtags, we delved into how media representations of immigration on Instagram effectively establish otherness between the different characters involved in this phenomenon. The border wall emerges as one of the main components in these narratives and a symbol of the temporal and spatial stages of the migratory journey. Meanwhile, the voice of the main character, the migrant, is mostly absent, often conveyed through biased views, filtered by the opinions of posters about immigration and characterized by new narrative configurations enabled by the Instagram format.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article makes legible emergent social imaginaries of digital touch for remote communication in personal relationships, with attention to digital touch interfaces. It draws on data from rapid prototyping research workshops with apprentice professionals embedded within digital communication. Touch is discussed with respect to four analytical themes: materiality, body, emplacement and temporality. We illustrate how participants’ past and present experiences and future visions of remote digital touch thread through these themes and weave together to form a hegemonic, emergent sociotechnical imaginary of digital touch. The article contributes to social debates within digital personal remote communication by foregrounding touch, the material and the sensorial. The article’s novel interdisciplinary framework (combining design-based rapid prototyping with a multimodal and multi-sensorial analysis within the frame of the sociotechnical imaginary) also contributes to methodology around future-facing phenomena, prior to the process of their solidification into material, political formations.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We interviewed 61 Muslims in 15 focus groups from the most visible Muslim population in the United States: the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Participants shared their experiences of and responses to Islamophobia on social media and face-to-face during the 2016 US presidential election campaign and aftermath. Applying Fraser’s and Squires’ theories of counterpublics, we developed an adapted understanding of counterpublics in collapsed contexts of online and face-to-face spaces. We argue that everyday Muslim internet users in the United States are an example of a hyper differential counterpublic. They face the pressures of near ubiquitous and ever evolving Islamophobic attacks, while needing to engage with the internet for personal and professional purposes. We suggest that hyper differential counterpublics operate in collapsed contexts of mixed, unimaginable publics, switch between group and individual responses, and craft hyper situational responses to discriminations case by case.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A few cross-sectional studies have found that selfie-related behaviors have positive associations with self-objectification or appearance concerns, but little is known about whether bidirectional relationships exist between selfie behaviors and these body-related variables over time. The present study examined the reciprocal relationships between selfie-related behaviors and both self-objectification and appearance concerns among adolescents using a longitudinal design. Chinese adolescent boys and girls completed questionnaires at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. The key constructs included selfie-posting, selfie-editing, selfie-viewing, self-objectification, facial dissatisfaction, and body dissatisfaction. Results indicated that selfie-editing, but not selfie-posting, predicted increases in adolescents’ self-objectification and appearance concerns (both body and face) over time. Selfie-viewing predicted increases in self-objectification and facial dissatisfaction, but not body dissatisfaction over time. In the other direction, adolescents’ antecedent levels of self-objectification predicted increases in subsequent selfie-related behaviors. In addition, adolescents’ facial dissatisfaction positively predicted selfie-viewing and selfie-editing but not selfie-posting over time, whereas body dissatisfaction had no influence on subsequent selfie-related behaviors among adolescents. Findings from this study provide new insights into the reciprocal relationships between selfie-related behaviors and body image.</content:encoded>

Interviews with workers and managers unearth the material and cultural infrastructures that underpin Amazon labor. Early Italian operaismo, or workerist theory, offers a framework to analyze digital capitalism’s strategies to secure workers’ cooperation with machinery.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study examines the current feminist counterculture movements which appears to be reinvigorating the Egyptian public sphere. The study argues women in particular have been able to find themselves alternative ways to develop a discourse focused on a desire for social changes around which they can unite. In focusing on lifestyle issues that normally are discussed only in small private spheres, they are able to challenge norms while not provoking the state or security apparatus and avoiding becoming part of the polarised political environment. This article explores the dynamics and motivations of these groups through a case study of three of the networked feminist movements. Our data from semi-structured interviews with the founders show that they grew from networks to movements which then evolved in order to be sustainable.

Drawing on Chantal Mouffe’s work on political affect, this article examines how online anonymous communities use memetic literacy, memetic abstraction, and memetic antagonism to constitute themselves as political collectives. Specifically, it focuses on how the subcultural and highly reactionary milieu of 4chan’s /pol/ board does so through an anti-Semitic meme called triple parentheses. In aggregating the contents of this peculiar meme from a large dataset of /pol/ comments, the article finds that /pol/ users, or anons, tend to use the meme to formulate a nebulous out-group resonant with populist demagoguery.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Mobile gaming has experienced rapid growth with the development of mobile technology. A mechanic of constant risk in the mobile massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game Lords Mobile prompted us to investigate the effects of the game on players’ work activities. Through a 19-month virtual ethnography of Lords Mobile, we found that game and work activities affected each other. Study participants played the game at work due to the constant risk mechanic, resulting in time-based and strain-based work interference. Players also reported receiving some social support for work stress, but development and use of social capital around work topics was unexpectedly limited. Resisting the “work” and “non-work” binary, some players avoided some areas of interference by playing tactically throughout the day. In the context of work–game relationship, players reported interference more often than use of social capital or tactical play. We suggest that the constant risk mechanic needs more research and that players structuring their play and work activities so that the relationships between them are positive instead of negative could be called work–game balance.</content:encoded>

Resisting the “work” and “non-work” binary, some players avoided some areas of interference by playing tactically throughout the day. In the context of work–game relationship, players reported interference more often than use of social capital or tactical play. We suggest that the constant risk mechanic needs more research and that players structuring their play and work activities so that the relationships between them are positive instead of negative could be called work–game balance.</description>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article maps out how people in queer communities on Reddit navigate context collapse. Drawing upon data from interviews with queer Reddit users and insights from other studies of context collapse in digital media, we argue that context collapse also occurs in anonymity-based social media. The interviews reveal queer Reddit users’ practices of context differentiation, occurring at four levels: somatic, system, inter-platform and intra-platform. We use these levels to map out how lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) people express their identities and find community on Reddit while seeking to minimize the risks imposed by multiple impending context collapses. Because living an authentic queer life can make subjects vulnerable, we find that despite Reddit’s anonymity, sophisticated practices of context differentiation are developed and maintained. We argue that context collapse in an era of big data and social media platforms operates beyond the control of any one user, which causes problems, particularly for queer people.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article examines how market actors are actively engaged in state control of the Internet in China by studying the emerging industry of Internet-opinion management in that country. It presents an ecology of this industry, identifies three main market actors whose competitiveness is deeply rooted in the Chinese political context and identifies three stages of state-market collaboration. This article sheds light on how the rise of big data has strengthened state capacity for Internet control. It provides original evidence for how the profit motive drives Chinese data companies and media organisations to seek active involvement in the institutional construction of Internet-opinion control. This article also contributes to the literature on repression and contentious politics. It demonstrates that by relying on the market, authoritarian states are able to turn advanced technology into a repressive tool, which makes it more difficult for their citizens to use the Internet to mobilise.</content:encoded>

To theorize the role of digital media in the making of a heterotopia, I have studied Ängsbacka, a community for alternative lifestyles, in a small mid-Swedish town. Using the concept of heterotopia as a starting point to understand how Ängsbacka functions as a space outside of mainstream society, I then use media theories about disconnection and the avoidance of context collapse in the analysis of their media practices. The analysis shows that the community has an ambivalent set of both explicit and implicit rules and norms aiming at both inclusion and exclusion of digital media.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;From its origins in virtual financial transactions, emerging initiatives are seeking to acquire a new identity for blockchain as capable of addressing anxieties over the capacity of digital media to permanently and accurately store information. In this article, we explore the ensuing mediation between blockchain enterprises and new professional communities to which they are catering. Drawing on thematic analysis, we analyze how this process is being carried out through the discursive construction of trust, leveraged rhetorically in academic, trade, and news publications to extend an application for financial transactions to cultural institutions. We describe how trust is used not only to mediate the introduction of an application that prioritizes decentralization and cryptography, but is the turf on which traditional institutions are staking a claim as the trustworthy managers of digital records through their use of blockchain. The concept of the archival imaginary—a vision of what archives and blockchain should be and mean that pivots on imagined needs and technological capacities based on the current information ecology, institutional control, and expert systems—offers a way to illuminate this process.</content:encoded>

Survey findings show that aspects of tie strength—reciprocity, duration, and affect—have different impact on intention to participate in high- and low-cost political actions.

We employed hierarchical linear modeling to test how internal political efficacy and media environment—both political and technological, shape news engagement based on the multinational cross-sectional survey data (N = 72,930). The findings showed that internal political efficacy was positively associated with news engagement. Press freedom was negatively associated with user-content news engagement; Internet penetration was negatively associated with the three indicators of news engagement. Press freedom negatively moderated the effect of internal political efficacy on user-content news engagement. The study advances our understanding about the individual and contextual mechanisms of news engagement. It also renders significant implications for news organizations to consider the role of media environment while practicing engagement.</content:encoded>

However, knowledge of this for young people with disabilities is scarce. This study investigates digital participation of adolescents with intellectual disabilities by comparing aspects of Internet use among adolescents with and without intellectual disabilities. Cross-sectional comparative design was used and a national survey from the Swedish Media Council was cognitively adapted for adolescents with intellectual disabilities aged 13–20 years. The results reveal that a significantly lower proportion of the 114 participating adolescents with intellectual disabilities had access to Internet-enabled devices and performed Internet activities, except for playing games, than the reference group (n = 1161). The greatest difference was found in searching for information. Analyses indicate that adolescents with intellectual disabilities are following a similar pattern of Internet use as the reference group, but a digital lag is prevalent, and a more cognitively accessible web could be beneficial.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;One recent trend on Instagram consists of posting ‘Instagram vs reality’ images containing side-by-side photographs of the same woman, one an idealized depiction and the other a more natural depiction. This study aimed to experimentally investigate the effect of such images on body image. Participants were 305 women aged 18–30 years who were randomly assigned to view one of three sets of Instagram images: ‘Instagram vs reality’ images, the ‘ideal’ side alone or the ‘real’ side alone. As predicted, viewing the ‘Instagram vs reality’ and real images resulted in decreased body dissatisfaction relative to the ideal images. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of appearance comparison were much less marked for the ‘Instagram vs reality’ and real images than for the ideal images. It was concluded that ‘Instagram vs reality’ and real posts have the potential to bolster women’s body satisfaction, but more research is needed to assess their longer-term impact.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Political elections see several actors rise to the fore in order to influence and inform voters. Increasingly, such processes take place on social media like Facebook, where media outlets and politicians alike utilize seek promote their respective agenda. Given the recent rise of so-called hyperpartisan media—often described as purveyors of “fake news”—and populist right-wing parties across a series of western contexts, this study details the degree to which these novel actors succeed in overtaking their more mainstream or indeed established competitors when it comes to audience engagement on the mentioned platform. Focusing on the one-month period leading up to the 2018 Swedish national elections, the study finds that right-wing actors across the media and the political sector are more successful in engaging their Facebook followers than their competitors. As audience engagement is a key factor for social media success, the study closes by providing a discussion on the repercussions for professionals within the media and the political sector.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) are a separatist Manosphere group (digital manifestation of the Men’s Liberation Movement) who focus on individualistic, self-empowering actions as opposed to traditional collective actions typical of Men’s Rights Activists and Incels. This study investigates how the ideology and rhetoric of MGTOW propagates and normalises misogynistic beliefs through online harassment, using a multi-phased content and thematic analysis of 10,280 tweets from three of the most active MGTOW users on Twitter. The findings document a link between the MGTOW ideology and toxic masculinity, showing that the online harassment generated is deeply misogynistic and polices the boundaries of a heterosexual, hegemonic masculinity. The analysis demonstrates that while the misogyny and violence produced by MGTOW is not extreme in nature, their appeals to rational thinking make it seem like common sense. The article develops new knowledge about the heterogeneous nature of the Manosphere and its constructions of masculinity.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;New media provides new sources of information and communication that are crucial for participatory behaviors. Therefore, scholars conceptualize new media literacy (NML) that citizens should have to function successfully in this digital era. This study proposed and tested a structural model that examines multiple relationships among NML, communication skills (CS), and democratic tendency (DT). Data were collected from 1047 Turkish university students and analyzed through structural equation modeling. Using a comprehensive theoretical framework from the literature, NML was operationalized through four factors: functional consuming (FC), critical consuming (CC), functional prosuming (FP), and critical prosuming (CP). The results showed that FC and FP had a positive effect on CC, CP, and CS; CC had a positive effect on CP and DT; and CS had a positive effect on CC and DT. Findings of indirect effects revealed that CC and CS played mediation roles in the relationship of FC and FP with DT.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;The literature on public figures attacked by their audiences is unclear why female and male figures react differently to attacks. This study examines why female journalists are more likely than male journalists to use avoidance strategies as a reaction to online attacks. Avoidance includes limiting audience engagement, adapting reporting behavior, and thinking about quitting journalism. Drawing on social role theory and gender stereotypes, this study contrasts two explanatory hypotheses. The results, based on mediation analyses of online survey data of 637 journalists representative of Switzerland, show that women are more likely than men to use avoidance strategies because women are more stressed by attacks. This heightened stress is argued to result from differences in gender role socialization. In contrast, while women are somewhat more severely attacked than men, this cannot explain their greater probability of avoidance. Results contribute a theoretically and empirically rich explanation of gendered reactions to attacks.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Today, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning, is structurally dependent on human participation. Technologies such as deep learning (DL) leverage networked media infrastructures and human-machine interaction designs to harness users to provide training and verification data. The emergence of DL is therefore based on a fundamental socio-technological transformation of the relationship between humans and machines. Rather than simulating human intelligence, DL-based AIs capture human cognitive abilities, so they are hybrid human-machine apparatuses. From a perspective of media philosophy and social-theoretical critique, I differentiate five types of “media technologies of capture” in AI apparatuses and analyze them as forms of power relations between humans and machines. Finally, I argue that the current hype about AI implies a relational and distributed understanding of (human/artificial) intelligence, which I categorize under the term “cybernetic AI.” This form of AI manifests in socio-technological apparatuses that involve new modes of subjectivation, social control, and digital labor.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;We analyze information and communication technology in education initiatives in two South American countries: Bolivia and Uruguay. Utilizing qualitative data collection and analysis methods, we construct a comparative case study to trace the path of how national discourses—in response to the idea of globalization and initiatives promoting computers in education—were translated into policy goals, strategic implementation plans, and teaching and learning practices and outcomes. We document the role of the selected information and communication technology’s materiality in terms of portability and connectivity along this translation path. Our findings point to the importance of considering national discourse, often overlooked in information and communication technology in education studies, when examining initiative success and failure, and of conceptualizing materiality as more than merely the infrastructural foundation upon which information and communication technology in education initiatives are built. Understanding the role that materiality plays in interaction with national discourse may be especially important in guiding successful information and communication technology in education initiatives in developing countries, where financial resources are limited.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article assesses how social movements make use of media, and how their media practices influence movement outcomes using a case study of the Anti-National Education Movement in Hong Kong. It contributes to the literature on this important protest event and to ongoing debates about changes in the relationship between media and protesters. It is argued that activists adapted to what we call a “hybrid mediation opportunity structure.” The concept of a hybrid mediation opportunity structure is built on a critical engagement with Cammaerts’ mediation opportunity structure and is informed by Chadwick’s hybrid media system theory. We find that old (mainstream) and new (social) media tactics were deployed interdependently in a hybrid, symbiotic process. Old and new media logics fed off each other, in turn producing new logics: hybrid mediation opportunities which enabled activists to simultaneously broaden their connective networks and capture the attention of news media to publicize and legitimize their collective protests.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article argues that Airbnb should be understood as a new urban institution that is transforming relations between market, state, and civil society actors. Taking the Airbnb Citizen advocacy initiative as my case, I examine how this transnational “home sharing” platform achieves such transformations, which in turn requires an investigation into the specific nature of Airbnb as an institutional form. Assuming the agenda-setting role of the urban “regulatory entrepreneur,” Airbnb aims to co-shape the terms of current and future policy debates pertaining not just to home sharing/short-term rental but also to the very fabric of city life. It pursues this mode of “platform urbanism” by mobilizing its user base, which it frames as a community of entrepreneurial middle-class citizens looking to supplement their income in a climate of economic insecurity and tech-enabled opportunity. Yet, who is the “Airbnb Citizen” and what are the opportunities and risks associated with platform-mediated citizenship?</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Scholars have argued that digital spaces are key sites for feminist activism, which can be seen in the emergence of “hashtag feminism,” or the use of social media hashtags to address feminist-identified issues through sharing personal experiences of inequality, constructing counter-discourses, and critiquing cultural figures and institutions. However, more empirical research is needed that examines both the possibilities and constraints of hashtag feminism. Through a qualitative analysis of 51,577 archived tweets and semi-structured interviews, we trace the ways #WhyIStayed creates a space for feminist activism in response to victim-blaming related to domestic violence through voice, multivocality, and visibility. More specifically, we critically analyze postfeminist discourses within #WhyIStayed in order to examine contradictions within the hashtag event as well as how these postfeminist contradictions shape possibilities for feminist activism online.</content:encoded>

To encourage participation, most scholars suggested strategies to change participants’ motivation to adjust the way how they distribute their time resources. We, instead, view time as an evolving environment with specific temporal norms. This study employed a multi-level event history model to explore what factors affect response behaviors in an online policy discussion forum. By proposing four time-constant individual post factors and four time-varying environment factors, and analyzing 1798 posts in the forum, the study found that both individual post and environment factors are significant predictors of online interactions in different time phases. Some interaction effects between individual post and environment factors were also found. Rather than merely focusing on participants’ resource to take part in online discussions, we suggest that future studies should examine how contextual constraints that change over time can influence response behaviors.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article explores how video game players talk about the technological hardware they use to play games. The games industry is known for deploying often confusing and unclear ‘tech-speak’ terminology to convey the supposed value of new gaming hardware, drawing on tropes of numerical objectivity, ‘upgrade culture’ and the implicit obsolescence of previous technological iterations. However, we show a divide between supposedly objective tech-speak penned by the industry and the subjective experiences of users. Gamers rarely understand their gaming hardware through these marketing and advertising discourses despite their high visibility, instead framing the technology they engage with in intimately tactile, and more broadly contextual, terms. This highlights a significant disjuncture between the industrial and their perception of their audience, with implications for our understanding of ‘tech-speak’, its limitations, the video games sector and the consumers who purchase its products.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Audience analytics and metrics are ubiquitous in today’s media environment. However, little is known about how creative media workers come to understand the social norms related to those technologies. Drawing on social influence theory, this study examines formal and informal socialization mechanisms in U.S. newsrooms. It finds that editorial newsworkers express receiving a moderate amount of training on the use of analytics and metrics, which is typically provided by their organization; primarily look to people within the organization, and especially superiors, to understand the social norms; learn about those norms mostly through observation and communication about others’ experiences with the technology rather than their own; and that experiences are influenced by the organizational context and the individual’s position in the editorial hierarchy. This leads to a broader intervention to our understanding of the social structures and individual dispositions that influence how emerging technologies are experienced across organizational and institutional environments.</content:encoded>

This article focuses on the moments of bodily tension when spectators of esport attempt to emulate techniques and strategies derived from broadcasts of esport matches. I present findings from a wider study which reveal three tensions: (1) antagonistic relations between players’ bodily faculties and techniques shown in esports, enculturated through esports’ popularity, and its perpetuation of bodily mastery and technological competency as key ways of engaging with videogames; (2) an inability to habituate the timings of body required in emulating high-level techniques and (3) the emergence of negative affective states – such as panic or anxiety – in attempting to replicate strategies.

The article draws attention to the ‘social life’ that screenshots have beyond their duplicative function.

This article explores screenshots as powerful communicative tools and as a socio-cultural phenomenon worthy of further interrogation.</description>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article proposes a new model of privacy: infrastructural surveillance. It departs from Agre’s classic distinction between surveillance and capture by examining the sociotechnical claims of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as requiring totalising surveillance of passengers and environment in order to operate. By doing so, it contributes to the ongoing debate on the commodification and platformisation of life, paying attention to the under-explored infrastructural requirements of certain digital technologies, rather than its business model. The article addresses four distinct characteristics of infrastructural surveillance: the aggregation of data, initialisation of protocols limiting possible actions, the prioritisation of distributed modes of governance and the enclosure of the driver in a personalised bubble of sovereign power. Ultimately, unlike previous modes of computer privacy in which activities are being constructed in real time from a set of institutionally standardised parts specified by a captured ontology, we observe the creation of new ontologies.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This study is the first to explore the twin influences of online propaganda and news media on Islamists. We conducted 44 in-depth interviews with cognitively and behaviorally radicalized Islamist prisoners in Austria as well as former Islamists in Germany and Austria. We found that online propaganda and news media had interdependent influences on Islamists’ rejections of non-Muslims and Western politics, as well as on their willingness to use violence and commit suicide. Cognitively radicalized individuals were influenced by propaganda that blamed non-Muslims for opposing Islam; this was reinforced by online mainstream news reports of right-wing populism and extremism that propagandists selectively distributed via social media. Among behaviorally radicalized individuals, exposure to propaganda and news reports depicting Muslim war victims contributed to the radicalized individuals’ willingness to use violence. Moreover, propaganda and media reports that extensively personalized perpetrators of violence strengthened radicalized individuals’ motivations to imitate the use of violence.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;From a communication infrastructure theory perspective, this study examined local residents’ connections to neighborhood storytellers and its association with community-oriented emotional disclosure, a specific form of neighborhood storytelling, during an emergency event. A sample of 1676 local residents and their Twitter activities were obtained from Twitter’s streaming application programming interface (API) during a 2-hour window after the event. A connection was established when the focal user retweeted, commented on, or replied to another user. The results show that scope of connections to residents, community organizations, and mainstream media positively predicted community-oriented disclosure of negative emotions. Scope of connections to residents positively predicted community-oriented disclosure of positive emotions. Scope of connections to local media did not predict community-oriented emotional disclosure.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Previous research has examined how political expression on social media can affect young people’s engagement in political life. Yet a focus on dominant platforms (i.e. Facebook) and a lack of experimental studies have impeded theoretical understanding of how different features and affordances shape youth political expression. This study used a novel experimental paradigm to test how the design of social media sites can influence young people’s political expression. Participants (18–24 years) interacted with a fictional social media app that was manipulated in terms of identifiability and geo-boundedness. Users in anonymous (vs identifiable) environments reported less political self-presentation concern and were more likely to express their political opinions. In addition, unbounded (non-local) environments were perceived as better places to exert political voice and influence than bounded (local) environments. This study offers a promising starting point for studying and designing social media in which youth political expression can flourish.</content:encoded>

The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user’s mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved—but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user’s relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making.</content:encoded>

By focusing on care, the study calls for technical innovation that integrates moderators’ aims with artificial intelligence systems. Rather than acknowledging human skills and resources in terms of moderation tools and discussion culture, the current platform logic forces moderators to operate like machines. Their discontent becomes understandable within a logic that diminishes their skills and vision.

We find that the opinion leaders who emerge after a crisis are assumed to have local knowledge about the incident and/or are able to quickly curate information about the incident. In addition, we find that the quality of information spread by opinion leaders is critical to narrative construction and civility. The largely fact-based narratives associated with the FSU incident were far more civil than the OSU narratives, which were based on disinformation and polemics.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Many researchers have been studying teens’ privacy management on social media, and how they individually control information. Employing the theoretical framework of communication privacy management (CPM) theory, I argue that individual information control in itself is desirable but insufficient, giving only a limited understanding of teens’ privacy practices. Instead, I argue that research should focus on both personal and interpersonal privacy management to ultimately understand teens’ privacy practices. Using a survey study (n = 2000), I investigated the predictors of teens’ personal and interpersonal privacy management on social media and compared different types of boundary coordination. The results demonstrate that feelings of fatalism regarding individual control in a networked social environment, which I call networked defeatism, are positively related with interpersonal privacy management. Also, interpersonal privacy management is less important when coordinating boundaries with peers than it is when coordinating sexual materials, and dealing with personal information shared by parents.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Phatic communication is a mode of communication where the significative content of the used utterance gives way to the social bonding function of the utterance itself. This mode of communication appears to be increasingly common in our current media culture and is exemplified by frequent photo sharing through applications such as Snapchat. However, most theoretical discussions on phatic communication have taken place in the context of linguistic expressions. In this theoretical article, we broaden the focus to visual interpersonal communication by way of photography theory. We suggest that photographic phatic communication is based on the indexicality of the medium itself and the sense of presence it produces. We argue further that, contrary to previous literature, photographic phatic communication is not without meaningful content. However, we propose that it is connected, primarily, to the material indexicality of the photograph and only secondarily to the signifying function of the iconic content.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Through an online survey of Beijing consumer publics, this study examines a moderated mediation model of public demand for regulatory intervention ensuing from a corporate crisis that entirely unfolded on social media platforms. The study finds that highly involved publics tend to attribute crisis responsibility more to the in-crisis company, and such attribution leads to stronger demand for regulatory intervention. However, the effects of issue involvement on public demands decrease when publics think they have collective efficacy to control crisis outcomes and that government has controllability over crisis outcomes. The study further finds that, in determining the degree of public demand, how publics attribute crisis responsibility is not as important as how they perceive government controllability. By delineating the relationships among issue involvement, responsibility attribution, perceived government controllability, and collective efficacy, this study outlines a comprehensive psychological mechanism of public demand for regulatory intervention during corporate crisis.</content:encoded>

Random assignment to play a game as an immigration inspector decreased intention and attitudes toward helping immigrants relative to baseline scores. These effects were observed while controlling for social dominance orientation or preference for inequality among social groups. The intention and attitudes of participants randomly assigned to play a control group game featuring the role of a newspaper editor remained unchanged. Overall, this study expanded perspective-taking research by replicating theoretical predictions with a different sample.

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Social media platforms such as Facebook have been understood to present new possibilities for interaction. Yet, there have been concerns surrounding the reducing quality of our interaction and conversation. Such debates, however, have not considered the pre-post dimension of online environments: that is, the preparatory work that occurs to online posts before they are shared with their audience. Based on real-time recordings of Facebook Messenger interactions, this article asks what the pre-post perspective tells us about the quality of our interactions online. The analysis is theoretically informed by Goffman and methodologically by conversation analysis and addresses this question with a specific focus on processes of identity construction and face. In presenting innovative screen capture data, this article argues against claims that our interaction online is declining in quality instead showing the ways users perfect their online posts by elaborating a new stage of online communication: the ‘rehearsal’ stage.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Electronic identification services (eIDs) have become strategic services in the global governance of online societies. In this article, we argue that eIDs are sociotechnical constructs that also have political-economic dimensions. In the European context, governmental and corporate efforts to develop eIDs are shaped by legal EU frameworks, which are almost exclusively focussed on technical and legal interoperability, such as the European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA). Public concerns such as privacy, security, user empowerment and control over one’s personal information prompts developers to propose a decentralized, attribute-based system governed on a nonprofit, nonstate basis (DAN-eID). To illustrate our argument, we explore a single emerging eID system (IRMA; acronym for I Reveal My Attributes) that is developing in a national context (The Netherlands). We argue that developing eIDs requires more than engineering ingenuity and legal compliance; as sociotechnical and political-economic constructs, they involve negotiation of conflicting social and political values.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In online dating, the self-authored profile serves as the primary way for daters to introduce themselves to others and to learn more about potential partners. However, few studies have examined the extent to which daters’ self-authored profile content is consistent with the impressions that others actually form. This study applied the Brunswikian lens model (1956) to examine self-presentation and impression formation in the text-based “about me” portion of the online dating profile. Using the meaning extraction method, we analyzed 190 profiles. Consistent with the lexical approach to personality, daters were able to encode aspects of themselves through linguistic self-description (cue validity), and observers were able to decode profile information to form impressions (cue utilization). However, there were few significant associations between a dater’s self-presentation and observers’ judgments (functional achievement). Findings are interpreted in line with previous work examining self-presentation and impressions in online dating profiles.</content:encoded>

Through a thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with key stakeholders at the negotiation table, we find that rather than positivist notions of the ‘developing’ and ‘vulnerable’ child dominating policy discourse, post-modern representations of the ‘savvy’ and ‘agentic’ child have come to dominate policy culture and outcomes. In this scenario, the regulatory role of states in providing media protection is diminished, while neoliberal forms of governance that emphasise the responsibility of individuals, including parents and children, have come to dominate the emerging policy landscape.</content:encoded>

The data suggested that self-reported measures of offline civic engagement, bonded social capital, and ideological extremity were predictive of a self-reported measure of general online political engagement. For its part, self-reported levels of online political engagement were positively and significantly associated with observed political expression on Facebook. These results are discussed in the context of both on and offline political connection and communication.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Web 2.0 has facilitated a particularly toxic brand of digital men’s rights activism, collectively known as the Manosphere. This amorphous network of online publics is noted for its virulent anti-feminism, extreme misogyny and synergies with the alt-right. Early manifestations of this phenomenon were confined largely to 4/Chan, Reddit and numerous alt-right forums. More recently, however, this rhetoric has become increasingly evident in Urban Dictionary. This article presents the findings of a machine-learning and manual analysis of Urban Dictionary’s entries relating to sex and gender, to assess the extent to which the Manosphere’s discourses of extreme misogyny and anti-feminism are working their way into everyday vernacular contexts. It also considers the sociolinguistic and gender-political implications of algorithmic and linguistic capitalism, concluding that Urban Dictionary is less a dictionary than it is a platform of folksonomies, which may exert a disproportionate and toxic influence on online discourses related to gender and sexuality.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;A growing body of research suggests that young women tend to replicate normative feminine cues popularized through mass media in their selfies, or self-taken mobile phone photographs. Among these stereotypical cues are posing behaviors documented in Goffman’s gender display framework, which visualize a power imbalance between men and women. We completed a content analysis to investigate gender display in young women’s Instagram selfies alongside its relationship to feedback such as likes and comments. In this study, a novel scalar measure of gender display captures both the categorical manifestation and the exaggeration of gender stereotypical cues. We found that gender display is prevalent in women’s Instagram selfies but presented in subtle ways. In addition, women who incorporate and exaggerate gender displays in their selfies tend to receive more feedback. We suggest that gender stereotyping in Instagram selfies is related to reinforcing feedback and call for closer measurement and contextualization of gender performance in user-generated content.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article develops a Digital Capital Index by adopting the definition provided by Ragnedda, who defines Digital Capital as the accumulation of digital competencies and digital technologies, and the model for measuring it developed by Ragnedda and Ruiu. It aims to develop a measure that can be replicated for comparison in different contexts. This article contributes both theoretically and empirically to the literature by (a) consolidating the concept of Digital Capital as a specific capital and (b) empirically measuring it. A Digital Capital Index is developed through an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and validated with a representative sample survey of 868 UK citizens. The validation procedure shows that the Digital Capital Index is associated with socioeconomic and sociodemographic patterns, such as age, income, educational level and place of residence, while it appears not to be related to gender.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;In our article, we investigate the affective economy of national-populist image circulation on Facebook. This is highly relevant, since social media has been an essential area for the spread of national-populist ideology. In our research, we analyse image circulation as affective practice, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. We use computational data analysis methods to examine visual big data: image fingerprints and reverse image search engines to track down the routes of thousands of circulated images as well as make discourse-historical analysis on the images that have gained most attention among supporters. Our research demonstrates that these existing tools allow social science research to make theory-solid approaches to understand the role of image circulation in creating and sustaining national and transnational networks on social media, and show how national-populist thinking is spread through images that catalyse and mobilise affects – fear, anger and resentment – thus creating an effective affective economy.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;This article introduces the idea of ‘affective coding’ as a form of affectively loaded, digital social steganography – a form of hiding messages – as it presents findings from interviews with new fathers struggling to cope with and disclose mental illnesses, against the context of cultures of silencing. While previous expositions of online social steganography have considered its role in privacy management or its employment in concealing identities, we conceptualise affective coding as an agentic and discursive-material digital practice of attempted revelation, occupying a liminal space between silence and more explicit attempts to reach out, disclose and seek support. Our findings show men undertaking a range of seemingly minor online acts, each demonstrating subtle strategies of managing self-disclosure and social media architecture, and each encoded with a substantial amount of affective investment. We discuss motivations, strategies and outcomes of affective coding, before discussing its significance for self-disclosure in platform societies.</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>New Media &amp;amp;Society, Ahead of Print. &lt;br/&gt;Journalists, scholars, and citizens have raised concerns regarding the high share of incivility in comment sections of news outlets. The current study surveyed members of the social movement #ichbinhier, which aims at collectively countering uncivil comments to cultivate a civil discussion atmosphere in comment sections. We root the activities of #ichbinhier as corrective action and identify the determinants of the members’ engagement by integrating research on bystander behavior and collective action. The findings of our survey show that factors pertaining to individual skills, perceived responsibility, and expected benefits relate to the members’ likelihood to engage against uncivil online comments. Regarding factors derived from collective action research, group efficacy and knowledge of the rules and structures of the movement account for higher levels of engagement. These results shed light on the factors that motivate and inhibit #ichbinhier members—and, potentially, Facebook users in general—to engage against uncivil comments.</content:encoded>
